```blocks3
    when I start as a clone
    pick-costume (collectable-type) :: custom
    show
    repeat until <(y position) > [170]>
        change y by (collectable-speed)
        if <touching [Player Character v]?> then
            change [points v] by (collectable-value)
            delete this clone
