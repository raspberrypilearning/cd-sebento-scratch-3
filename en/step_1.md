## Introduction

These are the Advanced Scratch Sushi Cards, and in them youâ€™ll be making a platform-style game which you can later add your own levels, powers and characters to.

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/219285989/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

### What you will learn

+ Cloning sprites
+ Using variables inside cloned sprites
+ Creating and using "More" blocks
+ Reusing code in several places with "More" blocks
+ Messages to trigger behaviours across sprites
+ Using variables to configure your program
