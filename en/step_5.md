## Power-ups

On the last card you saw the collectable I created. It’s a fart cloud that just adds one point when you grab it. That’s pretty boring.

On this card, you’re going to create a new collectable, but you’re going to do it in a way that makes adding more collectables easy, so you can invent your own power-ups and bonuses and really make the game your own!

+ Add a new costume to the `Collectable` sprite for your new power-up. I've drawn a supersize fart cloud, but you can make whatever you like!

I’ve already included some pieces to make this easier for you with the `collectable-type`{:class="blockdata"} variable and the `pick costume`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} **More** block. You’re going to need to improve on them though.
